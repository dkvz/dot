# DkVZ Dotfiles
It's a little rough, I use variants of these on very different systems (including Windows).

## Gedit
It's just a theme file for gedit, to be loaded from its preferences menu.

## Neovim
My [Neovim config](https://github.com/dkvz/nvim) is on its own repo.

I use both vim (general text editing, I open multiple ones) and nvim (IDE, programming, usually only open it once).
